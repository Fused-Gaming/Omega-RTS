# OMEGA R.T.S.

**The Last Strategy Game Ever**

---

## What It Is

OMEGA R.T.S. is a team-based, free-for-all real-time strategy protocol where **capital, governance, and endurance** decide outcomes.

Players do not gamble. They **commit resources over time**, govern themselves on-chain, and endure systemic attrition driven by **immutable external events**. Wars are finite. Loss is gradual. Victory is earned through survival.

---

## Core Thesis

Most strategy games end when players quit.

OMEGA removes quitting.

* Capital is reminding logistics, not power
* Time is the primary pressure
* Reality — not RNG or developers — judges decisions

> *You do not leave the war. You endure it.*

---

## Game Structure

* **Wars:** 7–30 day sealed conflicts
* **Teams:** 4–12 sovereign factions per war
* **Entry:** Mandatory capital stake (time-locked)
* **Exit:** Elimination or victory only

No late entries. No instant losses. No resets mid-war.

---

## Player Roles (Per Team)

* **Commander:** Strategic direction
* **Quartermaster:** Treasury & logistics
* **Tacticians:** Operational timing
* **Governors:** Binding governance votes
* **Scouts / Saboteurs:** Intelligence & misdirection

Roles are season-bound, auditable, and governable.

---

## Attrition (The Core Mechanic)

OMEGA replaces sudden loss with **structured decay**:

* Idle capital decays
* Hoarding is penalized
* Engagement mitigates loss

Attrition is **predictable, visible, and unavoidable**.

---

## Reality-Bound Events

Strategic consequences are tied to **immutable on-chain events**:

* Bitcoin halving cycles
* Prediction market resolutions
* Chain congestion & liquidity stress
* External DAO governance outcomes

Players cannot influence these events — only prepare for them.

> Strategy is tested against reality, not luck.

---

## Interstitial Warfare (Between Votes)

Between major governance decisions, teams engage in **low-lethality maneuvering**:

* Recon & intelligence gathering
* Logistics optimization
* Decoys & doctrinal feints
* Counter-intelligence & signal hardening

These actions shape **confidence, foresight, and survivability** — not instant wins.

---

## Governance

### In-War Governance

* Binding votes
* Emergency powers
* Capital sacrifices

Bad governance accelerates collapse. Good governance delays it.

### Meta-Governance

* War parameters
* Attrition curves
* Treasury allocation

The protocol evolves without invalidating history.

---

## Elimination & Redistribution

A team is eliminated when it:

* Falls below operational capital
* Loses command structure
* Votes to surrender

Eliminated capital is **redistributed**:

* War pool
* Surviving teams
* Protocol treasury

No winner-take-all wipes. Loss is earned over time.

---

## Sustainability (The Non-Exploitative House)

OMEGA earns revenue through:

* Time-based staking yield
* War initiation fees
* Governance execution & role minting

The protocol **never bets against players** and **never manipulates outcomes**.

---

## Ethical Position

OMEGA is not gambling.

* No instant wins
* No instant losses
* No dopamine loops

Failure is slow, strategic, and public.

---

## Final Statement

**The war ends when reality decides it does.**

---

**OMEGA R.T.S.**
*The Last Strategy Game Ever.*
